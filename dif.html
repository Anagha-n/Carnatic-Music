                    Sholars establish the “scientific” moorings of traditional music.
                     Besides Sanskrit and Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam have long been used for song lyrics.

                       about the people who settled and worked throughout the Western United States and Western Canada.

              <h2>Carnatic Music</h2>
            </div>
            <p>In carnatic music there is always scope for improvisation as we could always add any kalpana swaras
               (which are imaginary swaras in the same raga as the song used to emphasise raga in the song. it can be added even in between the song.) 
              Carnatic music has 5 different components, 2 of which are used even in western music.
              <ul>
                <li>Raagam or Melody <br>
                This is a set of swaras which are combined together by certain rules, have particular prominent notes and patterns. </li>
                <li>Taalam or Rhythm <br>
                  This is the rhythmic framework in Carnatic music which tells you where to start the note of the song.
                   It is the external form of laya. There are different forms of taalams.
                   They consist of fixed cycles called avarthanas.</li>
                   <li>Laya or Internal Rhythm <br>
                    Laya is the tempo of music used as reference for the singer. it is used only in carnatic music.
                  </li>
                   <li>Shruti or Drone <br>
                  Which is the constant note during the song and helps the singer.</li>
                  <li>Monophonic <br>
                  This is specific to carnatic music, monophonic basically means that all the insuruments and the singer will be 
                playing or singing the same tune.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Western Music</h2>
            </div>
            <p> 
              All Western classical music compositions are formally written using the staff notation,
               and performers have virtually no latitude for improvisation. But even western music has it's own good qualities
               it is scientifically proven to enhance cognitive performance, it is intricate and complex so people like listening to it.
              western music also has 4 components of which 2 are the same as carnatic music.
              <ul>
                <li>Melody <br> This the product of many pitches in music when you move from,
                   different pitch to pitch it becomes melody.</li>
                <li>Polyphonic <br>
                  This is specific to western music, polyphonic basically means that there can/will be 2 
                different notes or chords playing at the same time.</li>
                <li>Harmony <br>
                  Harmony is the sound of things that go together well — people singing in harmony are in tune with each other.</li>
                <li>Rhythm <br>
                  The beat is the pulse of the music and tempo is how fast that pulse is moving. These are two parts of Rhythm in western music.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
